**Url and Handling URl's in NodeJs**
so at first we open our terminal and write 'npm init' and fill up all nd after that, 
we can download 'nodemon', npm i nodemon.(To help when we create changes in code then the server refresh)

In 'Package.json' we can change like that:
"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon index.js"
  },

We can use http and file System.

So when we can use url, at first Download that to use terminal 'npm i url', and require in code  like that -
const url=require('url')
