At First we can open our terminal and write 'npm init' and fillup all that.
We use npm because here we create the server and we can run so much time and restart so we can download this.

in package.json file we can re-write some comment
"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon index.js" //this is for the start 
},

And we can download Nodemon becase when we can save the server then autometacilly restart the server

Here we can use http module and require that

const http=require('http'); //http module required

//create the server
const Myserver=http.createServer((req,res)=>{  //response and request handlers.
    console.log('new req resseaved');
    res.end('hello From Server');
})

//port
const port=8000; //port number
Myserver.listen(port) 
After we create server we can run on our search enngine ex- localhost:8000
